The above text was a request we previously made.
When we ran our tests, it did not output the expected ACL list we needed.
Take a look at the ACL that was generated by us in the orignal prompt, that is correct.
The following sections are all responses that you (the LLM) have sent us.
    The section titles LLM responses.
The other sections labelled "LLM ACL ANALYTICS"
    Has some details on how many over or under permissions that the rules you generated granted.
Take a look at all the data and keep in mind the orignal prompt request.
Now try and generate the ABAC rules again, while fixing the issues caused by the previous set of rules you generated.
Remember your response should only be the set of ABAC rules you generate.
