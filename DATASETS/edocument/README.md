# Policy Description: Edocument

*Vesion: v20250324*

This policy governs a SaaS electronic document processing application provided by eDocs, which facilitates the secure distribution of digital and printed documents for various organizations.

Tenants (eDocs customers) use the application to send documents such as invoices, contracts, and notifications to their employees or customers. Documents can be delivered digitally via email, through postal services, or integrated with other platforms.

The policy defines access rules for eDocs employees and specific tenants, such as Large Bank and NewsAgency. Permissions to view, send, or manage documents depend on factors such as the user’s role, department, managerial supervision, and assigned projects within eDocs. 

This policy is available as a case study in *Decat et al. (2014)*, which provides further details.
